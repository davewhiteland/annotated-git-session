# An annoted Git session

A [single web-page showing a git session](https://davewhiteland.github.io/annotated-git-session/)
for introducting newcomers to Git to some of the basic ideas.

The session starts by creating a directory and a file called `hello.html` with these contents:

```HTML
<html>
 <body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>Don't panic.</p>
 </body>
</html>
```

During the session, this image is added to the HTML: [mars.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davewhiteland/annotated-git-session/master/mars.jpg)
